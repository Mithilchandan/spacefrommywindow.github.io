the objects that creates this brilliant effect by different names, depending 
on where it is.
Meteoroids are what we call “space rocks” that range in size from dust grains to 
small asteroids. This term only applies when they’re in space
Most are pieces of other, larger bodies that have been broken or blasted off.
 Some come from comets, others from asteroids, and some even come from the Moon 
and other planets. Some meteoroids are rocky, while others are metallic, or 
combinations of rock and metal.
When meteoroids enter Earth’s atmosphere, or that of another planet, like Mars, 
at high speed and burn up, they’re called meteors. This is also when we refer 
to them as “shooting stars.” Sometimes meteors can even appear brighter than 
Venus -- that’s when we call them “fireballs.” Scientists estimate that about 
48.5 tons (44,000 kilograms) of meteoritic material falls on Earth each day.
When a meteoroid survives its trip through the atmosphere and hits the ground, 
it’s called a meteorite.</center></font><br><hr>
