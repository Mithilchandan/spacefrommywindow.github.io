<center><font color="red"><h3>There are currently five planets classified as dwarf planets:
 Ceres, Pluto, Makemake, Haumea and Eris. Except for Ceres,
 which lies in the main asteroid belt, these small planets are 
located in the Kuiper Belt. Theyâ€™re considered dwarfs because they 
 are massive, round, and orbit the Sun, but haven't cleared their orbital path.</h3></font></center>

<center><font color="red"><h3>Pluto is a complex and mysterious world with mountains, valleys, plains, craters,
 and maybe glaciers. Discovered in 1930, Pluto was long considered our 
solar system's ninth planet. But after the discovery of similar intriguing worlds
 deeper in the distant Kuiper Belt, icy Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet.
Pluto is orbited by five known moons, the largest of which is Charon. Charon is 
about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to
 the planet it orbits in our solar system. Pluto and Charon are often 
referred to as a "double planet."
 Pluto is named after the Roman god of the underworld.</h3></font></center>
