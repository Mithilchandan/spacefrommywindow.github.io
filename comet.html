<center><font ="red"> In the distant past, people were both awed and alarmed by 
comets, perceiving them as long-haired stars that appeared in the sky unannounced 
and unpredictably. Chinese astronomers kept extensive records for centuries, 
including illustrations of characteristic types of comet tails, times of cometary 
appearances and disappearances, and celestial positions. These historic comet 
annals have proven to be a valuable resource for later astronomers.
We now know that comets are leftovers from the dawn of our solar system around
 4.6 billion years ago, and consist mostly of ice coated with dark organic 
material. They have been referred to as "dirty snowballs." They may yield 
important clues about the formation of our solar system. Comets may have brought
 water and organic compounds, the building blocks of life, to the early Earth and
 other parts of the solar system.</center></font><br><hr>
